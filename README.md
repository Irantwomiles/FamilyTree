# FamilyTree

This is a project I started to help my family keep track of everyone and their decendents. It uses a MERN tech stack.

# Tech Stack

As I said, this project uses a MERN tech stack. The front-end is done using React.js with Hooks and components that I wrote. The 
data is stored in a MongoDB database. The backend is written in Node.js and Express with the help of the MongoDB wrapper mongoose.
Using Express I created a RESTful API that returns values that are needed by the front-end. The front-end just uses AJAX calls to 
the backend for these data values.
